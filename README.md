# [TITS] Multi-Objective Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem: Formulation and Algorithm

This repository contains the code implementation of the paper 

"<u>**Multi-Objective Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem: Formulation and Algorithm**</u>".

 In this paper, we propose an ILS-based metaheuristic algorithm called AMOILS/D for the Multi-Objective Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem (MO-HFVRP).

See [AMOILS-D](https://github.com/yunpengba7/AMOILS-D) for details.
